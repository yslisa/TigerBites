Our software product will to notify users via phone and/or email when a “favorited” dining item is being served at one of the dining halls.  After creating an account, a user can add dining items to his or her list of favorites by clicking a plus sign beside an dining item when logged in.  There will be several menu interfaces from which users can select favorites:
One of these interfaces will present a list of the residential colleges.  By clicking on a residential college, a user will expand the breakfast, lunch, and dinner dining items for the current day.
Another interface will present a search bar and several search specifications so that users can search for and select their favorite dining item.
In addition to modifying favorited dining items, a user will be able to submit suggestion letters to Princeton Dining Services.  A user will be able to access the suggestion box by clicking on a link to it from the main page.
